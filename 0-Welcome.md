# Data stuctures Tutorial

Welcome to the Python Fundamentals Tutorial.  Every beginning Python programmer should understand these data structure topics:

- [Stacks](1-Stacks.md)
- [Sets](2-Sets.md)
- [Binary Search Tree](3-bst.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples.  At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own.  You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
